### Cards

- **Dracula:** Purple glowing shadows
- **MBP:** Dramatic red glowing box shadows
- **LSU:** Purple shadows with potential gold accents

### H4 Headings
CSS rules ensure H4 visibility across all themes:
- Lines 197-211 explicitly set heading colors to light variants for dark themes

- This ensures excellent contrast for all heading elements

### About Page Specific Elements
- Cards have theme-specific styling with appropriate shadows and borders
- Background colors for cards inherit from primary backgrounds
- All themes maintain distinct visual separation between cards and backgrounds

### Logout Page Elements
- Form inputs have theme-specific styling
- Dark themes use darker input backgrounds with light text
- Focus states add glowing effects matching theme colors

## Accessibility Findings

### ✅ Strengths
1. **Excellent Contrast Ratios:** All themes exceed WCAG AAA standards (7:1) with ratios above 17:1
2. **Consistent Heading Visibility:** H4 and other headings explicitly styled for each theme
3. **Enhanced Dark Mode Support:** Each dark theme has carefully chosen colors for readability
4. **Visual Feedback:** Hover and focus states provide clear interaction feedback

### ⚠️ Considerations
1. **Accent Colors:** Secondary text colors (purple in Dracula, light purple in LSU) should be tested in context
2. **Glow Effects:** While visually appealing, ensure glow effects don't reduce text readability
3. **Input Fields:** Dark theme inputs use backdrop blur which may affect performance on older devices

## Theme-Specific Observations

### Light Theme

- Excellent for daytime use or bright environments
- Standard accessibility compliance

### Dark Theme
- Well-balanced dark mode with blue-gray tones
- Enhanced shadows provide good depth perception
- Slate color palette ensures consistency

### Dracula Theme
- Distinctive purple/cyan accent colors
- Maintains Dracula theme authenticity while ensuring readability
- Glowing effects add visual interest without compromising usability

### MBP Theme
- Dramatic red accents appropriate for medical/cancer center branding
- Very dark backgrounds with high contrast
- Glowing effects create urgency and attention

### LSU Theme
- University colors (purple and gold) well integrated
- Deep purple backgrounds maintain readability
- Dual-color glow effects for school spirit

## Recommendations

1. **Test Accent Colors in Context:** While primary text has excellent contrast, verify that purple/cyan text in Dracula and secondary colors in other themes maintain readability in all contexts.

2. **Monitor Glow Performance:** The dramatic glow effects in MBP and LSU themes should be tested on various devices to ensure smooth performance.

3. **Consider Reduced Motion:** Add `prefers-reduced-motion` media queries to tone down glow animations for users with motion sensitivity.

4. **Validate Color Blind Accessibility:** While contrast is excellent, test themes with color blindness simulators, especially for the color-heavy LSU and MBP themes.

5. **Document Theme Usage:** Consider adding theme descriptions to help users choose (e.g., "MBP - High contrast with red accents, ideal for medical professionals").

## Conclusion

All five themes demonstrate excellent attention to accessibility and visual design. Each theme maintains contrast ratios well above WCAG standards while providing distinct visual identities. The specialized styling for cards, headings, and interactive elements ensures consistent user experience across all themes. The implementation shows sophisticated use of CSS custom properties and theme-specific enhancements that don't compromise usability.

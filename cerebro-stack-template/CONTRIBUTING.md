## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

Before creating bug reports, please check existing issues as you might find out that you don't need to create one. When you are creating a bug report, please include as many details as possible. Fill out the required template, the information it asks for helps us resolve issues faster.

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:
- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

### Suggesting Enhancements

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as GitHub issues. When creating an enhancement suggestion, please include:
- Use a clear and descriptive title
- Provide a step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement
- Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps
- Describe the current behavior and explain which behavior you expected to see instead
- Explain why this enhancement would be useful

### Your First Code Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing? You can start by looking through these `beginner` and `help-wanted` issues:

* [Beginner issues](https://github.com/yourusername/yourproject/labels/beginner) - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
* [Help wanted issues](https://github.com/yourusername/yourproject/labels/help%20wanted) - issues which should be a bit more involved than `beginner` issues.

### Pull Requests

The process described here has several goals:
- Maintain project quality
- Fix problems that are important to users
- Engage the community in working toward the best possible project
- Enable a sustainable system for maintainers to review contributions

Please follow these steps to have your contribution considered by the maintainers:

1. Follow all instructions in [the template](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md)
2. Follow the [styleguides](#styleguides)
3. After you submit your pull request, verify that all [status checks](https://help.github.com/articles/about-status-checks/) are passing

## Development Process

### Setting Up Your Development Environment

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourproject.git
   cd yourproject
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/setup.sh
   ```

3. Make your changes:
   - Write code following our style guides
   - Add tests for your changes
   - Update documentation as needed

4. Run tests to ensure everything works:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/run-tests.sh
   ```

5. Commit your changes using conventional commits:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "feat: add new feature"
   ```

6. Push to your fork and submit a pull request

### Development Workflow

1. **Create an Issue**: Before starting work, create or find an issue describing what you want to do
2. **Discuss**: For significant changes, discuss your approach in the issue before starting
3. **Branch**: Create a feature branch from `main`
4. **Code**: Make your changes following our guidelines
5. **Test**: Ensure all tests pass and add new tests as needed
6. **Document**: Update documentation to reflect your changes
7. **Commit**: Use meaningful commit messages
8. **Push**: Push your branch to your fork
9. **PR**: Submit a pull request referencing the issue

## Styleguides

### Git Commit Messages

We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

* Use the present tense ("add feature" not "added feature")
* Use the imperative mood ("move cursor to..." not "moves cursor to...")
* Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
* Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

Examples:
```
feat: add user authentication
fix: resolve race condition in data sync
docs: update API documentation
style: format code according to style guide
refactor: restructure user service
test: add missing tests for user service
chore: update dependencies
```

### TypeScript/JavaScript Styleguide

* Use TypeScript for all new code
* Follow the existing code style
* Use meaningful variable and function names
* Add JSDoc comments for public APIs
* Prefer functional programming patterns
* Avoid mutations when possible

```typescript
// Good
export function calculateTotal(items: Item[]): number {
  return items.reduce((sum, item) => sum + item.price, 0);
}

// Bad
export function calc(i: any[]) {
  let t = 0;
  for (let x = 0; x < i.length; x++) {
    t += i[x].price;
  }
  return t;
}
```

### Python Styleguide

* Follow PEP 8
* Use type hints for all functions
* Use docstrings for all public functions
* Prefer descriptive names over comments
* Use Black for formatting
* Use Ruff for linting

```python
# Good
async def get_user_by_email(email: str) -> User | None:
    """Retrieve a user by their email address.
    
    Args:
        email: The email address to search for
        
    Returns:
        The user if found, None otherwise
    """
    return await User.find_one({"email": email})

# Bad
async def getUser(e):
    # get user by email
    return await User.find_one({"email": e})
```

### Documentation Styleguide

* Use Markdown for all documentation
* Reference code with proper syntax highlighting
* Include examples for all features
* Keep documentation up-to-date with code changes
* Use clear, concise language
* Include diagrams where helpful

## Testing Guidelines

### Writing Tests

* Write tests for all new features
* Ensure tests are deterministic
* Use descriptive test names
* Follow the AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
* Mock external dependencies
* Aim for high test coverage

```typescript
// Example test
describe('UserService', () => {
  it('should create a new user with valid data', async () => {
    // Arrange
    const userData = { email: 'test@example.com', name: 'Test User' };
    
    // Act
    const user = await userService.create(userData);
    
    // Assert
    expect(user.email).toBe(userData.email);
    expect(user.name).toBe(userData.name);
    expect(user.id).toBeDefined();
  });
});
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
./scripts/run-tests.sh

# Run frontend tests
npm run test

# Run backend tests
pytest

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_users.py
npm run test -- UserService.test.ts
```

## Code Review Process

All submissions require review. We use GitHub pull requests for this purpose. Consult [GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) for more information on using pull requests.

### Review Criteria

* **Testing**: Are there adequate tests?
* **Documentation**: Is the code well-documented?
* **Style**: Does the code follow our style guides?
* **Performance**: Are there any performance concerns?
* **Security**: Are there any security issues?

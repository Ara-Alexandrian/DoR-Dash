- **üî• Moderate (Level 2)**: Standard academic feedback expectations
- **‚ò¢Ô∏è Intense (Level 3)**: Rigorous critical evaluation

#### Purpose
Provides faculty with a structured way to communicate feedback expectations to colleagues, ensuring appropriate evaluation intensity based on student level, presentation type, and learning objectives.

### 3. Meeting Agenda Integration

**Seamless integration with existing agenda system:**
- **New "Assigned Presentations" section** with purple theme
- **Timeline integration** showing assignments in meeting schedules
- **Time allocation** based on duration_minutes or 20-minute default
- **Role-based visibility** for grillometer settings and faculty notes

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Backend Development

#### Database Schema
```sql
presentation_assignments table:
- id, student_id, assigned_by_id, meeting_id
- title (tentative title), description, presentation_type (enum)
- duration_minutes, requirements, due_date
- grillometer_novelty, grillometer_methodology, grillometer_delivery (1-3)
- is_completed, completion_date, notes
- created_at, updated_at
```

#### API Endpoints
- `GET/POST /api/v1/presentation-assignments/` - List/create assignments
- `GET/PUT/DELETE /api/v1/presentation-assignments/{id}` - Individual management
- Enhanced `GET /api/v1/meetings/{id}/agenda` - Includes presentation assignments

#### Key Technical Features
- **Enum validation** for presentation types
- **Foreign key relationships** with proper cascade deletion
- **Eager loading optimization** with SQLAlchemy joinedload()
- **JSON serialization fixes** for FastAPI responses

### Frontend Development

#### User Interface
- **Responsive design** working across all themes (dark, MBP, LSU, dracula)
- **Grillometer visual controls** with emoji-based indicators
- **Checkbox requirements** with custom input support
- **Inline editing** capabilities with real-time validation

#### Integration Points
- **Meeting agenda display** with expandable sections
- **Timeline scheduling** with automatic time calculation
- **Role-based UI** rendering based on user permissions
- **Theme compatibility** across all color schemes

## üêõ Issues Resolved

### Critical Bug Fixes

1. **JSON Serialization Error**
   - **Issue**: FastAPI couldn't serialize SQLAlchemy Meeting objects
   - **Solution**: Convert to dictionary format before JSON response
   - **Impact**: Fixed 500 errors on meeting agenda endpoint

2. **Database Enum Type Mismatch**
   - **Issue**: presentation_type field using String instead of Enum
   - **Solution**: Changed to proper Enum(PresentationType) mapping
   - **Impact**: Proper validation and type safety

3. **Role Permission Issues**
   - **Issue**: Case sensitivity in role checks preventing faculty access
   - **Solution**: Consistent .toUpperCase() usage throughout
   - **Impact**: Faculty can now create assignments properly

4. **Authentication Flow Problems**
   - **Issue**: Frontend not properly handling JWT tokens
   - **Solution**: Identified root cause (misreported 401 as 500 errors)
   - **Impact**: Improved error reporting and debugging

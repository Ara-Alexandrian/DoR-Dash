# Presentation Assignment System Documentation

## Overview

The DoR-Dash Presentation Assignment System provides a comprehensive solution for faculty and administrators to assign, track, and manage student presentations within the research meeting framework. The system integrates seamlessly with meeting agendas and includes a novel "Grillometer" feedback intensity system.

## System Architecture

### Database Schema

The system is built around the `presentation_assignments` table with the following structure:

```sql
CREATE TABLE presentation_assignments (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    student_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES user(id),
    assigned_by_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES user(id),
    meeting_id INTEGER REFERENCES meeting(id),
    
    -- Assignment Details
    title VARCHAR(500) NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    presentation_type presentation_type_enum NOT NULL,
    duration_minutes INTEGER,
    requirements TEXT,
    
    -- Scheduling
    due_date TIMESTAMP,
    assigned_date TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    
    -- Status Tracking
    is_completed BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT FALSE,
    completion_date TIMESTAMP,
    
    -- Grillometer Settings (1-3 scale)
    grillometer_novelty INTEGER,
    grillometer_methodology INTEGER,
    grillometer_delivery INTEGER,
    
    -- Metadata
    notes TEXT,
    extra_data JSON,
    created_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

### Presentation Types

The system supports multiple presentation types via enum:

- `CASUAL` - Informal research update or discussion
- `MOCK_DEFENSE` - Practice run for thesis or dissertation defense
- `PRE_CONFERENCE` - Practice for upcoming conference presentation
- `THESIS_PROPOSAL` - Formal thesis proposal presentation
- `DISSERTATION_DEFENSE` - Final dissertation defense

## Grillometer System

The Grillometer is a unique feature that allows faculty to set feedback intensity expectations across three dimensions:

### Scale Definition
- **1 (üßä Relaxed)**: Gentle feedback, focus on encouragement
- **2 (üî• Moderate)**: Standard academic feedback level
- **3 (‚ò¢Ô∏è Intense)**: Rigorous critical evaluation

### Dimensions

#### Novelty Assessment (`grillometer_novelty`)
How critically faculty should assess the originality and innovation of the research:
- **Relaxed**: Focus on understanding and clarity over novelty
- **Moderate**: Standard evaluation of contribution significance
- **Intense**: Rigorous assessment of innovation and uniqueness

#### Methodology Review (`grillometer_methodology`) 
How rigorously faculty should examine the research methods:
- **Relaxed**: Basic methodology review, focus on learning
- **Moderate**: Standard methodological scrutiny
- **Intense**: Comprehensive evaluation of experimental design and validity

#### Presentation Delivery (`grillometer_delivery`)
How critically faculty should evaluate presentation skills:
- **Relaxed**: Supportive feedback on communication skills
- **Moderate**: Standard presentation evaluation
- **Intense**: Professional-level presentation standards

### Example Usage
A faculty member might set a 3-2-1 grillometer for a PhD student's mock defense:
- **Novelty (3)**: Intensely evaluate the research contribution
- **Methodology (2)**: Standard review of experimental approach  
- **Delivery (1)**: Relaxed on presentation skills to reduce stress

## Frontend Implementation

### Assignment Management Page (`/presentation-assignments`)

The main interface provides:
- **Assignment List**: All assignments with filtering by status and user
- **Create/Edit Forms**: Comprehensive assignment creation with inline editing
- **Grillometer Controls**: Visual interface for setting feedback intensity
- **Requirements Checkboxes**: Structured requirement selection
- **Role-based Access**: Faculty/admin can create, students can view their assignments

### Meeting Agenda Integration

Presentation assignments appear in meeting agendas in two places:

#### 1. Assigned Presentations Section
- **Purple-themed section** showing all assignments for the meeting
- **Detailed view** with grillometer settings (faculty-only)
- **Completion status** and assignment metadata
- **Faculty notes** (role-restricted)

#### 2. Presentation Schedule Timeline
- **Time-slot calculation** based on meeting start time and duration
- **Visual highlighting** for assigned presenters
- **Integration** with student updates and general agenda items

### UI Components

#### Grillometer Display
```svelte
<div class="text-lg mb-1">
  {#if assignment.grillometer_novelty === 1}üßä
  {:else if assignment.grillometer_novelty === 2}üî•
  {:else if assignment.grillometer_novelty === 3}‚ò¢Ô∏è
  {:else}‚ùì{/if}
</div>
```

#### Requirements Display
- **Checkbox format** for clear requirement tracking
- **Custom requirements** with text input support
- **Backward compatibility** with string-based requirements

## Role-Based Access Control

### Permissions Matrix

| Action | Student | Faculty | Admin |
|--------|---------|---------|-------|
| View own assignments | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ |

- **API versioning** for future breaking changes
- **Database migration scripts** for production deployments

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 500 Error on Meeting Agenda
**Symptom**: Internal server error when accessing meeting agenda
**Cause**: JSON serialization of SQLAlchemy objects
**Solution**: Ensure Meeting object is converted to dictionary before JSON response

#### Assignment Not Appearing in Agenda
**Symptom**: Assignment exists but doesn't show in meeting agenda
**Cause**: Missing meeting_id or incorrect eager loading
**Solution**: Verify meeting_id is set and joinedload() includes assignment relationships

#### Permission Denied for Faculty
**Symptom**: Faculty user cannot create assignments
**Cause**: Case sensitivity in role checks
**Solution**: Use `.toUpperCase()` or `.upper()` for role comparisons

#### Grillometer Icons Not Displaying
**Symptom**: Question marks instead of emoji icons
**Cause**: Missing font support or incorrect value handling
**Solution**: Verify emoji support and check grillometer value ranges (1-3)

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Check assignment database entries
docker exec -it dor-dash-backend psql -U postgres -d dor_dash -c "SELECT * FROM presentation_assignments;"

# Verify user roles
docker exec -it dor-dash-backend psql -U postgres -d dor_dash -c "SELECT username, role FROM user;"

# Check meeting relationships
docker exec -it dor-dash-backend psql -U postgres -d dor_dash -c "SELECT pa.id, pa.title, m.title as meeting_title FROM presentation_assignments pa JOIN meeting m ON pa.meeting_id = m.id;"
```

## Conclusion

The Presentation Assignment System represents a significant enhancement to the DoR-Dash platform, providing structured presentation management with innovative feedback guidance through the Grillometer system. The integration with meeting agendas creates a seamless workflow from assignment creation to presentation delivery, supporting the academic research community's collaborative needs.

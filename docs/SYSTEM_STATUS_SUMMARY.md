## Current Issues and Priorities

### ðŸš¨ HIGH PRIORITY (Immediate Fix Required)

#### 1. Student Update Creation Failure
- **Error:** `AttributeError: 'StudentUpdateCreate' object has no attribute 'to_agenda_item_create'`
- **Location:** `backend/app/api/endpoints/updates.py:86`
- **Impact:** Students cannot submit updates (core functionality broken)
- **Fix Required:** Add missing method to `StudentUpdateCreate` schema
- **Code Solution:**
  ```python
  def to_agenda_item_create(self):
      from app.schemas.agenda_item import AgendaItemCreate
      return AgendaItemCreate(
          meeting_id=self.meeting_id,
          user_id=self.user_id,
          item_type=AgendaItemType.STUDENT_UPDATE,
          # ... content mapping
      )
  ```

#### 2. Faculty Update Listing Failure  
- **Error:** HTTP 500 Internal Server Error on GET requests
- **Endpoint:** `GET /api/v1/faculty-updates/`
- **Impact:** Cannot retrieve existing faculty updates
- **Investigation Required:** Check faculty update list endpoint implementation

### ðŸŸ¡ MEDIUM PRIORITY (Planned Improvements)

#### 1. Legacy Table Cleanup
- **Issue:** Unused legacy tables still exist in database
- **Impact:** Unnecessary complexity and potential confusion
- **Plan:** Remove legacy dependencies once API stability confirmed

#### 2. Performance Optimization  
- **Target:** Optimize JSONB queries for large datasets
- **Plan:** Add specialized indexes and query patterns
- **Benefit:** Better performance as data volume grows

#### 3. Code Repository Consistency
- **Issue:** Development and production code synchronization
- **Plan:** Regular commits and deployment verification
- **Benefit:** Consistent codebase across environments

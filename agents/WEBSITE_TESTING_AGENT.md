## Testing Workflows

### 1. Authentication Testing
```bash
# Test login endpoint
curl -X POST http://172.30.98.177:1718/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"cerebro","password":"123"}'

# Test protected endpoints with token
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  http://172.30.98.177:1718/api/users/me
```

### 2. Registration Flow Testing
```bash
# Test student registration
curl -X POST http://172.30.98.177:1718/api/registration/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"testuser","email":"test@dor.edu","full_name":"Test User","password":"testpass123"}'

# Test admin approval workflow
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN" \
  http://172.30.98.177:1718/api/registration/pending
```

### 3. Meeting & Agenda Testing
```bash
# Test meeting creation
curl -X POST http://172.30.98.177:1718/api/meetings \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"title":"Test Meeting","description":"Test","meeting_type":"general_update","start_time":"2025-06-15T10:00:00","end_time":"2025-06-15T11:00:00"}'

# Test agenda item creation
curl -X POST http://172.30.98.177:1718/api/agenda-items \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"meeting_id":1,"item_type":"student_update","content":{"progress":"Test progress"}}'
```

### 4. File Upload Testing
```bash
# Test file upload
curl -X POST http://172.30.98.177:1718/api/files/upload \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -F "file=@test.pdf" \
  -F "agenda_item_id=1"

# Test file download
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  http://172.30.98.177:1718/api/files/1/download
```

## Quality Assurance Checklist

### Functional Testing
- [ ] User authentication (login/logout)
- [ ] Registration workflow (request → approval → account creation)
- [ ] Meeting management (create/edit/delete/view)
- [ ] Student updates (create/edit/view)

## Testing Environment Setup

Always verify the testing environment before starting:
1. Container accessibility via SSH
2. Application service status
3. Database connectivity
4. Test user account availability
5. Test data preparation if needed

Remember: Focus on realistic user scenarios and edge cases. Document all findings thoroughly for development team review.

### 2. Security & Permissions Testing
- Role-based access control validation (admin/faculty/student boundaries)
- Authentication flow testing (login/logout, session management)
- File access permissions and secure download verification
- API endpoint authorization checking
- Cross-user data access prevention testing

### 3. Performance & Reliability Testing

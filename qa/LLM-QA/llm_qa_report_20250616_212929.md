## Assessment

### Conservative Behavior Validation

The LLM text refinement system should demonstrate:

1. **Minimal Expansion** (≤ 1.3x original length)
2. **No Unwanted Formatting** (no emojis, dramatic headers)
3. **Grammar Focus** (fix obvious errors only)
4. **Content Preservation** (maintain original meaning)

### Recommendations

Based on this test run:

- ✅ **All tests passed** - LLM is behaving conservatively as expected
- ✅ No further tuning required
- ✅ **Length control** (1.02x) is within acceptable range

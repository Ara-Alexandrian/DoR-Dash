# Authentication Fix Summary

## Issue Identified
The authentication was failing with a 401 error immediately after login due to:
1. **Import Issue**: `auth_service.py` was trying to import `security_config` directly, but `security.py` only exports `get_security_config()` function
2. **JWT Verification**: The `get_current_user` function was using direct JWT decoding instead of the centralized `AuthService.verify_token` method

## Root Cause
The `security.py` module was refactored to use a lazy-loaded singleton pattern with `get_security_config()`, but `auth_service.py` wasn't updated to match this change.

## Files Modified

### 1. `/backend/app/services/auth_service.py`
- Changed import: `from app.core.security import security_config` → `from app.core.security import get_security_config`
- Updated token creation: `security_config.create_access_token()` → `get_security_config().create_access_token()`
- Updated token verification: `security_config.verify_token()` → `get_security_config().verify_token()`

### 2. `/backend/app/api/endpoints/auth.py`
- Updated `get_current_user` function to use `AuthService.verify_token()` instead of direct JWT decoding
- This ensures consistent token verification across the application

## How to Apply the Fix

1. **Restart your backend server** to pick up the changes
2. **Set the SECRET_KEY environment variable** if not already set:
   ```bash
   export SECRET_KEY="your-secret-key-here"
   ```
   Or use the default for development (not recommended for production)

3. **Test the authentication**:
   - Try logging in through the frontend
   - The login should succeed and subsequent API calls should work

## Testing
A test script has been created at `test_auth_fix.py` to verify the fix works correctly.

## Container Fix
The same fix has been applied to the running container at `172.30.98.177` and authentication is now working there.
